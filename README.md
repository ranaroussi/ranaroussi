### Hi, I'm Ran 👋

I'm a self-taught software engineer with 30+ years building production systems – from ad-serving engines delivering 3 billion ads daily to creating 📈 [yfinance](/ranaroussi/yfinance), one of the world's most widely adopted data libraries (10M+ monthly users).

I build production AI infrastructure at 🧠 [MUXI](https://muxi.org) and wrote the book on 📚[Production-Grade Agentic AI](https://productionaibook.com), the infrastructure handbook for autonomous systems that actually work at scale.

Through 🏢 [Automaze](https://automaze.io), I help teams bridge the gap between ideas, demos, and deployable systems using pragmatic engineering and production-ready infrastructure.

I host 🎙️ [Old School; New Tech](https://OldSchoolNewTech.com) – a podcast where old-school engineering meets new technology – and write 💌 [Code Daddy](https://aroussi.com/subscribe) - a newsletter filled with actionable tips, real-world strategies, and insider stories on coding, indie hacking, finance, and solo entrepreneurship.
